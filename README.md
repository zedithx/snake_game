# Note
This game mainly uses turtle library to function as well as tkinter for the GUI
Only Macbook will be able to run subprocess(sounds played in the game)
Windows will have to switch to winsound
To test basic functionality, comment out all subprocess/thread lines.
Make sure images and sounds are placed in a folder called "images" and "sounds" at the same directory level
as the main.py as the code takes relative path

# Installation
No pip install is required. All libraries are included in the basic python libraries already.

# Usage
Just click play to open up the turtle window and follow the instructions for the game.
Game is played by key bindings to WASD and arrow keys.
Press stop button on IDE or Ctrl + C in terminal to stop music from playing
