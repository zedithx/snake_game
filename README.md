# Note
Only Macbook will be able to run subprocess(sounds played in the game)
Windows will have to switch to winsound
To test basic functionality, comment out all subprocess/thread lines.
Make sure images and sounds are placed in a folder called "images" and "sounds" at the same directory level
as the main.py as the code takes relative path

# Installation
No pip install is required. All libraries are included in the basic python libraries already.

# Usage
Just click play to open up the turtle window and follow the instructions for the game.
Game is played by key bindings to WASD and arrow keys.
